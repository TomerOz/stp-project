"""BodyMap is a python package for running a task in which participants are
asked to initially rate the location and intensity of body sensations using
a silhouette. This is followed by a second phase in which they can also indicate
whether a sensation is unpleasant (red), pleasant (blue) or neutral / value-free (gray).

The package is meant to be integrated in a full experiment, but a sample
can be run (using the run_sample.py script).

Built by Eitan Hemed, for Omer Dar and Prof. Amit Bernstein
(University of Haifa, Department of Psychology).

Major dependencies:
- PsychoPy3 (3.2.4)
- cv2 (4.1.2)
- Scikit-Image (0.16.2)
